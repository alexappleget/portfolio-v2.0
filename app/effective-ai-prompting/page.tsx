              The overview provides a high-level summary of the product or

              will likely get the rest wrong.

              In my example, I included all relevant database tables up front.
              Why? Because this admin dashboard needs to read from and write to
              those tables. Giving the AI schema-level detail early helps it
              understand how the UI and logic should interact with the database.

                Before moving on, review your overview carefully to ensure it
                clearly explains what you&apos;re building, why it matters, and
                which core elements, like key features, data models, or user
                roles, should be included. This section is critical because it
                frames the context the AI uses to generate accurate and relevant
                output. A vague or incomplete overview often leads to misaligned
                results, so take the time to get it right.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-200">
              After writing the overview, the next section should break down
              each specific feature you want the AI to build. Think of this like
              writing a set of instructions per component or screen. If
              you&apos;re building a portfolio, this might include sections like
              the homepage, about page, or contact form, each with layout and
              behavior details. In my case, since I&apos;m building an admin
              dashboard tied to a database, I describe each table and explain
              exactly what functionality I want the dashboard to provide for
              managing that data.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-200">
              In the example above, I titled the section{" "}

                Database-Centric Feature Mapping
              </strong>{" "}
              because I was breaking down dashboard functionality based on
              database tables. You should name this section based on the
              organizing logic behind your featuresâ€”whether it&apos;s{" "}
              <strong className="text-purple-300">Portfolio Sections</strong>,{" "}
              <strong className="text-purple-300">E-Commerce Pages</strong>, or
              something else entirely. The label itself doesn&apos;t directly
              influence the AI, but it helps you and your team stay organized
              when reviewing or expanding the document later.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-200">
              Beneath your section title, create clear and well-structured
              subsections for each feature, database table, or page your product
              includes. This is arguably the most critical part of your PRD
              because it&apos;s where you translate your product vision into
              actionable, detailed instructions. The AI uses this section to
              understand functionality, structure, and interactions. So, the
              more precise and thorough you are here, the better your results
              will be. Missing or vague details often lead to misalignment and
              time-consuming reprompting. In my example above, I included just
              one subsection, since the others follow a similar pattern with
              slight variations in how I want each part to function.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-200">
              I name each subsection after the corresponding database table to
              help the AI map the functionality to the underlying data
              structure. Alongside that, I include a more human-readable name,
              usually the label I want displayed in the dashboardâ€™s sidebar tab,
              so the AI understands both the technical and user-facing contexts.
              Below the title, I add a brief description that acts like a
              mini-overview, summarizing the purpose of that section. I then
              describe the specific dashboard features I want for interacting
              with that table, such as: viewing entries, filtering, editing, or
              bulk actions. Finally, I include example user actions or workflows
              to ground the AI&apos;s understanding in real-world usage. These
              examples help align the output more closely with how the section
              should function in practice.

              starting with the global layout of the admin dashboard. Here, I
              define the core navigation structure, mapping each sidebar item to
              its corresponding data source. This ensures the AI aligns the
              interface with the backend logic we previously described. After
              that, I walk through specific views (starting with the Users
              section) as an example of how each page should be structured and
              what interactions should be available to the user.

              is compatible with my existing codebase and follows the
